1. Install libraries
--------------------

Firs thing we will have to install the library we will use. In that case
would be ggplot:

    require(ggplot2)

    ## Loading required package: ggplot2

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](ggplot_workshop_files/figure-markdown_strict/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
